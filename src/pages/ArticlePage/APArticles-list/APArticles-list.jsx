            In
          the summer, things get even more complicated. Not only do you have to
          find a sweat-free way to “dress to the nines”, but you have to strike
          the right balance between playful sunshine garb and formal
          occasionwear. This forces you to ask difficult questions, such as “Is
          this wrap dress more ‘I do’ or ‘BBQ?’” and “Does this hat make me look
          like a chic French woman, or a dishevelled bird?”
