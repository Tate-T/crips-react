          It’s a tricky thing, being a wedding guest. Among the endless list of
          requirements – buy a present, arrange accommodation, practise your
          small talk – there’s one obligation that trumps them all in terms of
          effort: fix up and look sharp. The rules surrounding wedding guest
          dressing are as nuanced as they come. There are some obvious musts –
          avoiding white is always a good idea – and others that are only
          acknowledged by serial wedding-goers, such as steering clear of
          stilettos unless you enjoy the feeling of numbness in your feet. In
          the summer, things get even more complicated. Not only do you have to
          find a sweat-free way to “dress to the nines”, but you have to strike
          the right balance between playful sunshine garb and formal
          occasionwear. This forces you to ask difficult questions, such as “Is
          this wrap dress more ‘I do’ or ‘BBQ?’” and “Does this hat make me look
          like a chic French woman, or a dishevelled bird?” It’s no mean feat,
          so here’s our handy guide to summer wedding guest dressing, with tips
          from industry experts on the trends and colours you need to know about
          this season .
